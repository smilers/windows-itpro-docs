This policy setting prevents users from running the interactive command prompt, Cmd.exe. This policy setting also determines whether batch files (.cmd and .bat) can run on the computer.

- If you enable this policy setting and the user tries to open a command window, the system displays a message explaining that a setting prevents the action.

- If you disable this policy setting or don't configure it, users can run Cmd.exe and batch files normally.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't prevent the computer from running batch files if the computer uses logon, logoff, startup, or shutdown batch file scripts, or for users that use Remote Desktop Services.

Prevents Windows from running the programs you specify in this policy setting.

- If you enable this policy setting, users can't run programs that you add to the list of disallowed applications.

- If you disable this policy setting or don't configure it, users can run any programs.

This policy setting only prevents users from running programs that are started by the File Explorer process. It doesn't prevent users from running programs, such as Task Manager, which are started by the system process or by other processes. Also, if users have access to the command prompt (Cmd.exe), this policy setting doesn't prevent them from starting programs in the command window even though they would be prevented from doing so using File Explorer.

> [!NOTE]
> Non-Microsoft applications with Windows 2000 or later certification are required to comply with this policy setting.

> [!NOTE]
> To create a list of allowed applications, click Show. In the Show Contents dialog box, in the Value column, type the application executable name (e.g., Winword.exe, Poledit.exe, Powerpnt.exe).
