This policy setting enables process mitigation options on svchost.exe processes.

- If you enable this policy setting, built-in system services hosted in svchost.exe processes will have stricter security policies enabled on them.

This includes a policy requiring all binaries loaded in these processes to be signed by microsoft, as well as a policy disallowing dynamically-generated code.

- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, these stricter security settings won't be applied.

<!-- Add any additional information about this policy here. Anything outside this section will get overwritten. -->

If you enable this policy, it adds code integrity guard (CIG) and arbitrary code guard (ACG) enforcement and other process mitigation/code integrity policies to SVCHOST processes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling this policy could cause compatibility issues with third-party software that uses svchost.exe processes. For example, third-party antivirus software.
