This policy setting prevents File Explorer from encrypting files that are moved to an encrypted folder.

- If you enable this policy setting, File Explorer won't automatically encrypt files that are moved to an encrypted folder.

- If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, File Explorer automatically encrypts files that are moved to an encrypted folder.

This setting applies only to files moved within a volume. When files are moved to other volumes, or if you create a new file in an encrypted folder, File Explorer encrypts those files automatically.
