This policy setting specifies whether Security Center is turned on or off for computers that are joined to an Active Directory domain. When Security Center is turned on, it monitors essential security settings and notifies the user when the computer might be at risk. The Security Center Control Panel category view also contains a status section, where the user can get recommendations to help increase the computer's security. When Security Center isn't enabled on the domain, neither the notifications nor the Security Center status section are displayed.

Note that Security Center can only be turned off for computers that are joined to a Windows domain. When a computer isn't joined to a Windows domain, the policy setting will have no effect.

- If you don't configure this policy setting, the Security Center is turned off for domain members.

- If you enable this policy setting, Security Center is turned on for all users.

- If you disable this policy setting, Security Center is turned off for domain members.
