# Extended Security Updates (ESU) program for Windows 10

<!-- 8280171-->
The Windows 10 Extended Security Updates (ESU) program gives customers the option to receive security updates for PCs enrolled in the program. ESU is a paid program that provides individuals and organizations of all sizes with the option to extend the use of Windows 10 devices past the end of support date in a more secure manner. For more information about the Windows 10 lifecycle, see the [Windows Lifecycle FAQ](/lifecycle/faq/windows).

Individuals or organizations who elect to continue using Windows 10 after support ends on October 14, 2025, will have the option of enrolling their PCs into a paid ESU subscription. The ESU program enables PCs to continue to receive critical and important security updates through an annual subscription service after support ends. The [Microsoft Security Response Center](https://msrc.microsoft.com/) defines the [severity rating for security updates](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/security-update-severity-rating-system).


## Device prerequisites

To be eligible to install updates from the ESU program, devices must be running Windows 10, version 22H2.

## Limitations

ESUs doesn't include the following items:

- New features
- Customer-requested nonsecurity updates
- Design change requests
- General support won't be provided for Windows versions past the end of support date. Support will be available only to those organizations that purchase ESU for specific situations concerning the security updates. To get technical support, organizations must have an active [support plan](https://www.microsoft.com/enterprise/services/unified-support-solutions) in place.

Customers also have the option to migrate to the cloud and subscribe to Windows 365 to make Windows 11 available to users on any device with a Cloud PC. Beginning October 14, 2025, Microsoft will no longer provide the following for versions of Windows 10 that reach end of support on that date:
