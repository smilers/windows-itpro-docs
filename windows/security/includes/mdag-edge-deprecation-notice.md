> [!NOTE]
> - Microsoft Defender Application Guard, including the [Windows Isolated App Launcher APIs](/windows/win32/api/isolatedapplauncher/), is deprecated for Microsoft Edge for Business and [will no longer be updated](/windows/whats-new/feature-lifecycle). To learn more about Microsoft Edge security capabilities, see [Microsoft Edge For Business Security](/deployedge/ms-edge-security-for-business).
> - Starting with Windows 11, version 24H2, Microsoft Defender Application Guard, including the [Windows Isolated App Launcher APIs](/windows/win32/api/isolatedapplauncher/), is no longer available.
> - Because Application Guard is deprecated there will not be a migration to Edge Manifest V3. The corresponding browser extensions and associated Windows Store app are no longer available. If you want to block unprotected browsers until you are ready to retire MDAG usage in your enterprise, we recommend using AppLocker policies or [Microsoft Edge management service](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-management-service). For more information, see [Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Application Guard](/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-windows-defender-application-guard).<!--8932292-->
