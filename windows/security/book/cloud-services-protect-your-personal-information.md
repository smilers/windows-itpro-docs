:::image type="content" source="images/cloud-security.png" alt-text="Diagram containing a list of security features for cloud security." lightbox="images/cloud-security.png" border="false":::

## Microsoft account

Your Microsoft account (MSA) provides seamless access to Microsoft products and services with just one sign-in, allowing you to manage everything in one place. You can easily keep track of your subscriptions and order history, update your privacy and security settings, monitor the health and safety of your devices, and earn rewards. Your information stays with you in the cloud, accessible across devices and operating systems, including iOS and Android.

You can even go passwordless with your Microsoft account by removing the password from your MSA:

- Use Windows Hello to eliminate the password sign-in method for an even more secure experience
- Use the Microsoft Authenticator app on your Android or iOS device
