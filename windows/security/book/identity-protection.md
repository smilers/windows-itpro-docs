Employes are increasingly targets for cyberattacks in organizations, making identity protection a priority. Weak or reused passwords, password spraying, social engineering, and phishing are just a few of the risks businesses face today.

Identity protection in Windows 11 continuously evolves to provide organizations with the latest defenses, including Windows Hello for Business passwordless and Windows Hello Enhanced Sign-in Security (ESS). By leveraging these powerful identity safeguards, organizations of all sizes can reduce the risk of credential theft and unauthorized access to devices, data, and other company resources.
