Applications are prime vectors for cyberattacks due to their frequent usage and access to valuable data. Common attempts include injection attacks that insert malicious code, man-in-the-middle attacks that intercept and potentially alter communication between users and applications, and various methods of tricking users into divulging sensitive information or changing system settings.

Windows 11 protects users, apps, and data with features like Windows App Control for Business and the Microsoft vulnerable driver blocklist, which help ensure that only trusted apps and drivers can run on the device.
