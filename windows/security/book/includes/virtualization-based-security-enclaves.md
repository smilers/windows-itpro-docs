## :::image type="icon" source="../images/new-button-title.svg" border="false"::: Virtualization-based security enclaves

A **Virtualization-based security enclave** is a software-based trusted execution environment (TEE) inside a host application. VBS enclaves enable developers to use VBS to protect their application's secrets from admin-level attacks.

VBS enclaves are available starting in Windows 11, version 24H2, and Windows Server 2025 on both x64 and ARM64.
