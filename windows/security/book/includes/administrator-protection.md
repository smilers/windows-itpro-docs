## :::image type="icon" source="../images/soon-button-title.svg" border="false"::: Administrator protection

When users sign in with administrative rights to Windows, they have the power to make significant changes to the system, which can impact its overall security. These rights can be a target for malicious software.

Administrator protection is a new security feature in Windows 11 designed to safeguard these administrative rights. It allows administrators to perform all necessary functions with **just-in-time administrative rights**, while running most tasks without administrative privileges. The goal of administrator protection is to provide a secure and seamless experience, ensuring users operate with the least required privileges.

When administrator protection is enabled, if an app needs special permissions like administrative rights, the user is asked for approval. When an approval is needed, Windows Hello provides a secure and easy way to approve or deny these requests.

> [!NOTE]
> Administrator protection is currently in preview. For devices running previous versions of Windows, refer to [User Account Control (UAC)](/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works).
