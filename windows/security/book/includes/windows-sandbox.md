## Windows Sandbox

Windows Sandbox provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run untrusted Win32 applications in isolation, using the same hardware-based virtualization technology as Hyper-V. Any untrusted Win32 app installed in Windows Sandbox stays only in the sandbox and can't affect the host.

Once Windows Sandbox is closed, nothing persists on the device. All the software with all its files and state are permanently deleted after the untrusted Win32 application is closed.
