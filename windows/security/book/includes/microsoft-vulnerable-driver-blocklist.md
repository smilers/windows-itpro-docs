## Microsoft vulnerable driver blocklist

The Windows kernel is the most privileged software and is therefore a compelling target for malware authors. Since Windows has strict requirements for code running in the kernel, cybercriminals commonly exploit vulnerabilities in kernel drivers to get access. Microsoft works with ecosystem partners to constantly identify and respond to potentially vulnerable kernel drivers. To prevent vulnerable versions of drivers from running, Windows has a *block policy* turned on by default. Users can configure the policy from the Windows Security app.
