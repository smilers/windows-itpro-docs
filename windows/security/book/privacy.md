Privacy is an important priority for individuals and organizations, and the rise of AI is bringing it into even sharper focus. Windows provides privacy controls that can be easily accessed in the Settings app or desktop system tray for speech, location, calendar, microphone, call history, and more. Users can also find more information and manage privacy settings for Microsoft apps and services by signing into their [account dashboard](https://privacy.microsoft.com/).
