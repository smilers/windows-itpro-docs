# Understand the AppLocker policy deployment process

This planning and deployment article for the IT professional describes the process for using AppLocker when deploying application control policies.

To successfully deploy AppLocker policies, you need to identify your application control objectives and construct the policies for those objectives. The key to the process is taking an accurate inventory of your organization's applications, which requires investigation of all the targeted business groups. With an accurate inventory, you can create and deploy policies that allow the organization's required applications and provide IT the control they need over the organization's app landscape.

The following diagram shows the main points in the design, planning, and deployment process for AppLocker.
