# Add rules for packaged apps to existing AppLocker rule-set

This article for IT professionals describes how to update your existing AppLocker policies for packaged apps using the Remote Server Administration Toolkit (RSAT).

You can create packaged app rules by updating your existing AppLocker rule set from any supported computer. Download and install the Remote Server Administration Toolkit (RSAT) from the Microsoft Download Center.

RSAT comes with the Group Policy Management Console that allows you to edit the GPO or GPOs where your existing AppLocker policy is authored. RSAT has the necessary files required to author packaged app rules.
