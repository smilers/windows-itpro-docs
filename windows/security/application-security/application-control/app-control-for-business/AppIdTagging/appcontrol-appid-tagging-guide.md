# App Control Application ID (AppId) Tagging guide

[!INCLUDE [Feature availability note](../includes/feature-availability-note.md)]

## AppId Tagging Feature Overview

The Application ID (AppId) Tagging Policy feature, while based off App Control for Business, doesn't control whether applications run. AppId Tagging policies can be used to mark the processes of the running application with a customizable tag defined in the policy. Application processes that pass the AppId policy receive the tag while failing applications don't.

## AppId Tagging Feature Availability

The App Control AppId Tagging feature is available on the following versions of the Windows platform:

Client:
- Windows 10 20H1, 20H2, and 21H1 versions only
- Windows 11

Server:
- Windows Server 2022
