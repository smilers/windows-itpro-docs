# Troubleshoot Windows Sandbox

This article lists some common issues with Windows Sandbox and possible solutions. To submit feedback about Windows Sandbox, see [Where can I provide feedback?](windows-sandbox-faq.yml#where-can-i-provide-feedback)

| Error | Possible Solution |
|--|--|
| `WININET_E_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` <br>`WU_E_PT_ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE` | Upgrade to Windows Sandbox app fails because user isn't connected to internet or network adapter is connected but no internet connection. Check your internet connection. |
| `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` | `.wsb` config file provided by the user doesn't exist. Make sure that the path to the `.wsb` file is correct. |
| `E_INVALIDARG` | The `.wsb` file provided by the user is invalid or has errors. Check the `.wsb` file. |
| `REGDB_E_IIDNOTREG` | Verify if Windows Sandbox component is enabled under 'Turn Windows features on or off'. For more information, see [Install Windows Sandbox](windows-sandbox-install.md) |
| `The following settings are enforced by your IT administrator.` | `.wsb` file has a setting enabled that is controlled via group policy. |
| `No hypervisor was found. Please enable hypervisor support.` | Windows Sandbox only supports Hyper-V Hypervisor. Third-party hypervisors are not supported. Ensure that Hyper-V is enabled. |
| `Cannot upgrade to the latest version of Windows Sandbox` | Ensure that your device has access to the Internet, Windows Update and Microsoft Store. Beginning with Windows 11, version 24H2, the old Windows Sandbox app attempts to download the latest version from the Store. If the upgrade fails initially, installation continues in the background while the user can still use the app. Additionally, the app is queued in the "Updates & downloads" section of the Microsoft Store app for users who wish to install it manually. |
| `E_FAIL`, or `E_UNEXPECTED` or general failure during installation. | Possible causes: <br><br>- Installing Windows Sandbox is disabled via group policy. Check with your IT Admin. <br>- Timeout error where we can't reach the Microsoft Store. Try again later. |
