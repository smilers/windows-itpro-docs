Windows Autopatch is a Windows service hosted in Azure Commercial that uses Windows diagnostic data. While customers with GCC tenants may choose to use it, Windows Autopatch is outside the [US Government community compliance (GCC)](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc#us-government-community-compliance) boundary. For a list of GCC offerings for Microsoft products and services, see the [Microsoft Trust Center](/compliance/regulatory/offering-home).

Windows Autopatch isn't available in Azure Government for [Office 365 GCC High and DoD](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-us-government/gcc-high-and-dod) tenants.
