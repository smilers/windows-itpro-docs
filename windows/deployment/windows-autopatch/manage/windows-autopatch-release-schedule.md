# Manage the Release schedule

[!INCLUDE [windows-autopatch-applies-to-all-licenses](../includes/windows-autopatch-applies-to-all-licenses.md)]

Windows Autopatch provides a unique update experience and a single view for all your current quality, feature, and driver and firmware releases. This view:

- Consolidates all your applicable policies into a view consolidated by releases
- Provides an all-up summary of the current release applicable to your tenant

When you select a release, Windows Autopatch provides a list view of associated policies and metrics including:

- Start and end dates
- percentage complete

These metrics are a summary of the individual workload views that should be used to manage your updates.

> [!NOTE]
> **The device count metric is only available if you have Windows Enterprise E3+ or F3 licenses (included in Microsoft 365 F3, E3, or E5) licenses and have [activated Windows Autopatch features](../overview/windows-autopatch-overview.md#windows-enterprise-e3-and-f3-licenses).**<p>[Feature activation](../prepare/windows-autopatch-feature-activation.md) is optional and at no additional cost to you if you have Windows 10/11 Enterprise E3 or E5 (included in Microsoft 365 F3, E3, or E5) licenses.</p><p>For more information, see [Licenses and entitlements](../prepare/windows-autopatch-prerequisites.md#licenses-and-entitlements). If you choose not to go through feature activation, you can still use the Windows Autopatch service for the features included in [Business premium and A3+ licenses](../overview/windows-autopatch-overview.md#business-premium-and-a3-licenses).</p>
