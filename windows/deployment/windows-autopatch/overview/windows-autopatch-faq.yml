  - name: General
    questions: 
      - question: What is the difference between Windows Update for Business and Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch is a service that removes the need for organizations to plan and operate the update process. Windows Autopatch moves the burden from your IT to Microsoft. Windows Autopatch uses [Windows Update for Business](/windows/deployment/update/waas-manage-updates-wufb) and other service components to update devices. Both are part of [Windows Enterprise E3+ and F3](../prepare/windows-autopatch-prerequisites.md#more-about-licenses).
      - question: Is Windows 365 for Enterprise supported with Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch supports Windows 365 for Enterprise. Windows 365 for Business isn't supported.
      - question: Will Windows Autopatch support local domain join Windows 10?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch doesn't support local (on-premises) domain join. Windows Autopatch supports [Microsoft Hybrid Entra join](/entra/identity/devices/concept-hybrid-join) or [Microsoft Entra join](/entra/identity/devices/concept-directory-join). 
      - question: Will Windows Autopatch be available for state and local government customers?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch is available for all Windows E3 customers using Azure commercial cloud. However, Autopatch isn't currently supported for government cloud (GCC) customers. Although Windows 365 Enterprise is in the Azure Commercial cloud, when Windows 365 Enterprise is used with a GCC customer tenant, Autopatch is not supported.

For more information, see [Windows Autopatch groups overview](../deploy/windows-autopatch-groups-overview.md) and [Manage Windows Autopatch groups](../manage/windows-autopatch-manage-autopatch-groups.md).
  - name: Manage updates
    questions:
      - question: Who can manage updates with activated Windows Autopatch features?
        answer: | 
          This only applies if you have E3+ or F3 licenses and have activated Windows Autopatch features. For more information, see [Features and capabilities](../overview/windows-autopatch-overview.md#features-and-capabilities).
      - question: What systems does Windows Autopatch update?
        answer: |
          - Windows 10/11 quality updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Windows 10/11 feature updates: Windows Autopatch manages all aspects of deployment rings.
          - Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise updates: All devices registered for Windows Autopatch will receive updates from the Monthly Enterprise Channel.
          - Microsoft Edge: Windows Autopatch configures eligible devices to benefit from Microsoft Edge's progressive rollouts on the Stable channel and will provide support for issues with Microsoft Edge updates.
          - Microsoft Teams: Windows Autopatch allows eligible devices to benefit from the standard automatic update channels and will provide support for issues with Teams updates.
      - question: What does Windows Autopatch do to ensure updates are done successfully?
        answer: |
          For Windows quality and feature updates, updates are applied to devices in a gradual manner. There's an evaluation period at each progression. This process is dependent on customer testing and verification of all updates during these rollout stages. The outcome is to ensure that registered devices are always up to date and disruption to business operations is minimized to free up your IT department from that ongoing task.
      - question: What happens if there's an issue with an update?
        answer: |
          Autopatch relies on the following capabilities to help resolve update issues:
          - Pausing and resuming: For more information about pausing and resuming updates, see [pausing and resuming Windows quality updates](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#pause-and-resume-a-release).
          - Rollback: For more information about Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, see [Update controls for Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](../manage/windows-autopatch-microsoft-365-apps-enterprise.md#microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-update-controls).
      - question: Can I permanently pause a Windows feature update deployment?
        answer: |
          Yes. Windows Autopatch provides a [permanent pause of a feature update deployment](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-feature-update-overview.md#pause-and-resume-a-release).
      - question: Will Windows quality updates be released more quickly after vulnerabilities are identified, or what is the regular cadence of updates?
        answer: |
          For zero-day threats, Autopatch will have an [Out of Band release](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#out-of-band-releases). For normal updates Autopatch, uses a [regular release cadence](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md) starting with devices in the Test ring and completing with general rollout to the Broad ring.
      - question: Can customers configure when to move to the next ring or is it controlled by Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          The decision of when to move to the next ring is handled by Windows Autopatch; it isn't customer configurable.
      - question: Does Autopatch support include and exclude groups, or dynamic groups to define deployment ring membership?
        answer: |
          Windows Autopatch doesn't support managing update deployment ring membership using your Microsoft Entra groups. For more information, see [Move devices in between deployment rings](../deploy/windows-autopatch-register-devices.md#move-devices-in-between-deployment-rings).
      - question: Does Autopatch have two release cadences per update or are there two release cadences per-ring?
        answer: |
          The release cadences are defined based on the update type. For example, a [regular cadence](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md) (for a Windows quality update would be a gradual rollout from the Test ring to the Broad ring over 14 days whereas an [Out of Band release](../manage/windows-autopatch-windows-quality-update-overview.md#out-of-band-releases) would roll out more rapidly.
  - name: Support
    questions:
      - question: What support is available for customers who need help with onboarding to Windows Autopatch?
        answer: |
          The FastTrack Center is the primary mode of support for customers who need assistance from Microsoft to meet the pre-requisites (such as Intune and Azure or Hybrid AD) for onboarding to Windows Autopatch. For more information, see [Microsoft FastTrack for Windows Autopatch](../manage/windows-autopatch-support-request.md#microsoft-fasttrack). If you have [Windows Enterprise E3+ or E5 licenses](../overview/windows-autopatch-overview.md#windows-enterprise-e3-and-f3-licenses) and you've [activated Windows Autopatch features](../prepare/windows-autopatch-feature-activation.md), you can [submit a support request](../manage/windows-autopatch-support-request.md) with the Windows Autopatch Service Engineering Team.
      - question: Does Windows Autopatch Support Dual Scan for Windows Update?
        answer: |
          Dual Scan for Windows has been deprecated and replaced with the [scan source policy](/windows/deployment/update/wufb-wsus). Windows Autopatch supports the scan source policy if the Feature updates, and Windows quality updates workloads are configured for Windows update. If Feature and Windows updates are configured for WSUS, it could cause disruptions to the service and your release schedules.
