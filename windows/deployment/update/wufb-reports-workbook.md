# Windows Update for Business reports workbook
<!-- MAX6325272, OS33771278 -->
[Windows Update for Business reports](wufb-reports-overview.md) presents information commonly needed by updates administrators in an easy-to-use format. Windows Update for Business reports uses [Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started) to give you a visual representation of your compliance data. The workbook is broken down into tab sections:

- [Summary](#summary-tab)
- [Quality updates](#quality-updates-tab)
- [Feature updates](#feature-updates-tab)
- [Delivery Optimization](#bkmk_do)
- [Driver updates](#driver-updates-tab)

## Open the Windows Update for Business reports workbook

To access the Windows Update for Business reports workbook:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Monitor** > **Workbooks** from the menu bar.
   - You can also type **Monitor** in the search bar. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.

1. When the gallery opens, select the **Windows Update for Business reports** workbook. If needed, you can filter workbooks by name in the gallery.
1. When the workbook opens, you may need to specify which **Subscription** and **Workspace** you used when [enabling Windows Update for Business reports](wufb-reports-enable.md).

> [!Important]
> Don't pin the Windows Update for Business reports workbook to an Azure dashboard. Using a pinned report loads an older copy of the report and it won't display any updates to the report template. <!--8689121-->

## Summary tab

The **Summary** tab gives you a brief high-level overview of the devices that you've enrolled into Windows Update for Business reports.  The **Summary** tab contains tiles above the **Overall security update status** chart.

### Summary tab tiles

Each of these tiles contains an option to **View details**. When **View details** is selected for a tile, a flyout appears with additional information.

:::image type="content" source="media/8037522-workbook-summary-tab-tiles.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the summary tab tiles in the Windows Update for Business reports workbook":::

| Tile name | Description | View details description |
|---|---|------|
| **Enrolled devices** | Total number of devices that are enrolled into Windows Update for Business reports | Displays multiple charts about the operating systems (OS) for enrolled devices: </br> **OS Version** </br> **OS Edition** </br> **OS Servicing Channel** </br> **OS Architecture**|
|**Active alerts** | Total number of active alerts on enrolled devices | Displays the top three active alert subtypes and the count of devices in each. </br> </br> Select the count of **Devices** to display a table of the devices. This table is limited to the first 1000 rows. Select `...` to export the full list, or display the query in [Log Analytics](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-tutorial). </br> </br> Select an **AlertSubtype** to display a list containing: </br> - Each **Error Code** in the alert subtype </br>- A **Description** of the error code </br> - A **Recommendation** to help you remediate the error code </br> - A count of **Devices** with the specific error code |
|  **Windows 11 adoption** | Number of devices that are running Windows 11 | Displays the following items: </br> - **Windows 11 Device Count** chart, broken down by Windows 11 version </br> - **Windows 11 Eligibility Status** contains a **Readiness status** chart that lists the count of devices by OS version that are either capable or not capable of running Windows 11. </br> - The **Device List** allows you to choose a Windows 11 **Ineligibility Reason** to display devices that don't meet the selected requirement. <!--8037522-->|

### Summary tab charts

The charts displayed in the **Summary** tab give you a general idea of the overall status of your devices. The two charts displayed include:

- **Overall security update status**: Gives you general insight into of the current update compliance state of your enrolled devices. For instance, if the chart shows a large number of devices are missing multiple security updates, it may indicate an issue in the software update process.

- **Feature update status**: Gives you a general understanding of how many devices are eligible for feature updates based on the operating system lifecycle.

Selecting the device count for the alert name displays a list of devices with the alert.</li><li> Select the count in the **TotalDevices** column to display a list of clients and their information for the deployment. <!--7626683--> </li></ul> </br> - The **Readiness** tab contains a chart that displays the number of devices that are **Eligible** and **Ineligible** to install expedited updates. The **Readiness** tab also contains a table listing the deployments for expedited updates. <!--8682382--> <ul><li> Select the count from the **Alerts** column to display devices with a status of **RegistrationMissingUpdateClient**, which means the device is missing the Update Health Tools. The Update Health Tools are installed starting with [KB4023057](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4023057) or from a [stand-alone package from the Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=103324). Example PowerShell script to verify tools installation: `Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Product \| Where-Object {$_.Name -match "Microsoft Update Health Tools"}` </li><li> Select the count of **TotalDevices** to display a list of devices in the deployment. <!--8682382-->|

Below the tiles, the **Quality updates** tab is subdivided into **Update status** and **Device status** groups. These different chart groups allow you to easily discover trends in compliance data. For instance, you may remember that about third of your devices were in the installing state yesterday, but this number didn't change as much as you were expecting. That unexpected trend may cause you to investigate and resolve a potential issue before end users are impacted.

## Understanding update states

Updates can go though many phases from when they're initially deployed to being installed on the device. Transition from one state to another can be rapid, which makes some states less likely to be displayed in reports. The workbook can report the following high-level states for a device update: <!--8052067-->

- **Offering**: The update is being offered to the device for installation
- **Installing**: The update is in the process of being installed on the device
- **Installed**: The update has been installed on the device
- **Canceled**: The update was canceled from the [deployment service](deployment-service-overview.md) before it was installed
- **Uninstalled**: The update was uninstalled from the device by either an admin or a user
- **OnHold**: The update was put on hold from the [deployment service](deployment-service-overview.md) before it was installed
- **Unknown**: This state occurs when there's a record for the device in the [UCClient](wufb-reports-schema-ucclient.md) table, but there isn't a record for the specific update for the specific device in the [UCClientUpdateStatus](wufb-reports-schema-ucclientupdatestatus.md) table. This means that there is no record of the update for the device in question.

## Customize the workbook

Since the Windows Update for Business reports workbook is an [Azure Workbook template](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-templates), it can be customized to suit your needs. If you open a template, make some adjustments, and save it, the template is saved as a workbook. This workbook appears in green. The original template is left untouched. For more information about workbooks, see [Get started with Azure Workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-getting-started).
