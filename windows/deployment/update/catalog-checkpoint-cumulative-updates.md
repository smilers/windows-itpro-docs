# Checkpoint cumulative updates and Microsoft Update Catalog usage
<!--9693727-->
Starting Windows 11, version 24H2, monthly security updates and optional nonsecurity preview release updates might be preceded by a checkpoint cumulative update. Devices updating from Windows Update (WU) and Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) release channels can continue to seamlessly install the latest monthly security update or the optional nonsecurity preview release regardless of whether there are any preceding checkpoint cumulative updates, so **update processes involving WU and WSUS remain unchanged**. This article covers how Microsoft Update Catalog users can easily update their devices (or images) through checkpoint cumulative updates.

## Checkpoint cumulative updates

Windows 11 quality updates use servicing technology and are built cumulatively from the time when a new Windows OS was released to manufacturing (RTM). These monthly updates include all the changes since RTM in the form of binary differentials computed from the initial version of those binaries.

With Windows 11, version 24H2, Microsoft introduced a new concept of checkpoint cumulative updates. This change allows you to get features and security enhancements via the latest cumulative update through smaller, incremental differentials containing only the changes since the previous checkpoint cumulative update. This change means that you can save time, bandwidth, and hard drive space.

Going forward, Microsoft might periodically release cumulative updates as checkpoints. The subsequent updates will then consist of:
- The update package files associated with the checkpoints, and
- New update package files that contain incremental binary differentials against the version of binaries in the last checkpoint.

This process might be repeated multiple times, thereby generating multiple checkpoints during the lifecycle of a given Windows release. The Windows 11, version 24H2 servicing stack can merge all the checkpoints and only download and install content that's missing on the device.

If any checkpoint cumulative updates precede a target update, a device or image needs to take all prior checkpoint cumulative updates before it can take the target update. In other words, a post-checkpoint latest cumulative update can be applied to images/devices that are on that checkpoint or on a subsequent latest cumulative update. For updates sourced from WU and WSUS this process happens seamlessly. You can continue to use the same tools and processes that you currently use for approving and deploying updates. We expect that your experience updating through a checkpoint cumulative update will position you to efficiently take future checkpoint cumulative updates.

### Applicability

A checkpoint cumulative update is just another monthly security update that informs how subsequent updates are built. There's no policy change or new requirement around when users must take these updates, though it's best practice to take monthly security updates at the earliest opportunity to keep your devices protected and productive.

### Update Windows installation media

This feature doesn't introduce any change to the applicability of monthly security updates. As before, these updates apply to the main OS (install.wim) and to WinPE (boot.wim) but not to WinRE (winre.wim).

WinRE is serviced by applying the servicing stack update from a cumulative update (latest cumulative update doesn't apply) and SafeOS Dynamic Update. This is how it has been for a while now, and there's no recent change to WinRE servicing and certainly no change due to the checkpoint cumulative updates feature. We understand that not everybody may have had a shared understanding about this, but applying servicing stack update then SafeOS Dynamic Update is the only way to ensure WinRE is serviced. For more information, see [Update Windows installation media with Dynamic Update](media-dynamic-update.md).


## Updating from the Microsoft Update Catalog

When installing a given monthly security or optional nonsecurity preview update, [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com) users can determine and download the prior checkpoint cumulative updates and apply them sequentially under certain situations, or in one go using Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM).

### Finding prior checkpoint cumulative updates

For a given update, users can look up the KB article and find all preceding checkpoints, if any, listed under the **Catalog** release channel. For instance, the 2024-12 monthly security update (KB5048667) has one preceding checkpoint cumulative update per [December 10, 2024-KB5048667 (OS Build 26100.2605)](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/708755a6-d809-4a8a-8d20-53c4108590e6#ID0ELBD=Catalog):

   > <b>Install each MSU file individually, in order</b> <p>Download and install each MSU file individually either using DISM or [Windows Update Standalone Installer](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/799ba3df-ec7e-b05e-ee13-1cdae8f23b19) in the following order: <ul><li> windows11.0-kb5043080-x64_953449672073f8fb99badb4cc6d5d7849b9c83e8.msu </li> <li>windows11.0-kb5048667-x64_d4ad0ca69de9a02bc356757581e0e0d6960c9f93.msu </li></ul>

Alternately, users can search the KB number in the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/) and select the **Download** button for the selected architecture. The download pop-up shows all prior checkpoints for the update so that users can conveniently download all `.msu` files and apply them to their image or device. For instance, Microsoft Update Catalog shows the [2024-12 cumulative update (KB5048667)](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5048667) has one preceding checkpoint cumulative update, [KB5043080](https://support.microsoft.com/help/5043080).

### Updating through checkpoint cumulative updates

**Device has the latest checkpoint cumulative update and doesn't need customization:**

Devices or images that have the latest checkpoint cumulative update installed and don't need Features on Demand (FoD) or language pack customization can be updated to the latest target cumulative update with no change to your existing process. You can copy the target `.msu` file from Microsoft Update Catalog and install it, for instance using [Add-WindowsPackage (DISM)](/powershell/module/dism/add-windowspackage) or [DISM operating system package (`.cab` or `.msu`) servicing command-line options](/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-operating-system-package-servicing-command-line-options).

Examples of eligible devices:

| Device is on | Needs to install| 
|---|---|
|<ul><li>The checkpoint cumulative update, 2024-09 (KB5043080)</li></ul>|<ul><li>A subsequent monthly security update like 2024-11 (KB5046617), or</li> <li>A subsequent optional nonsecurity release like 2024-11 (KB5046740) </li></ul>|
|<ul><li>A subsequent optional nonsecurity preview release like 2024-09 (KB5043178), or</li> <li> A subsequent monthly security update like 2024-10 (KB5044284)</li></ul>|<ul><li>A subsequent monthly security update like 2025-01 (KB5050009), or</li> <li> A subsequent optional nonsecurity release like 2024-11 (KB5046740) </li></ul>|

**Device needs FoD or language pack customization:**

Installing FoDs or language packs requires the full latest cumulative update payload, which now can be split across files associated with each preceding checkpoint cumulative update. So, when customizing FoDs or language packs for offline media, all prior checkpoint cumulative updates and the target cumulative update need to be installed regardless of whether the device already had any of the prior checkpoints cumulative update installed. This needs to be done using DISM.

1.	Copy the .msu files of the latest cumulative update (the target) and all prior checkpoint cumulative updates to a local folder. Make sure there are no other .msu files present.
1.	Mount the install.wim file.
1.	Run `DISM /add-package` with the latest `.msu` file as the sole target.
1.	Run `/Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup`.
1.	Unmount.
1.	Run `DISM /export-image` to optimize the image size, if that's important to you.  

**Device doesn't have the latest checkpoint cumulative update and doesn't need customization:**

Devices that aren't on the latest checkpoint cumulative update and don't need FoD/language pack customization can either install all needed cumulative updates one by one in the right sequence. Alternately they can be updated using DISM to install all cumulative updates in one go. For more information, see the [Updating through checkpoint cumulative updates](#updating-through-checkpoint-cumulative-updates) section. If there are total four checkpoint cumulative updates available and device already has the first one installed, DISM applies the remaining three checkpoint cumulative updates in the right order followed by the target cumulative update, all in one go.
