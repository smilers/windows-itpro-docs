# Microsoft Connected Cache for Enterprise and Education (early preview)

If you participated in the early preview program, thank you for your collaboration and feedback.

To continue using supported version of Microsoft Connected Cache, we strongly recommend that you upgrade your existing cache nodes to the new release. Cache nodes created and deployed during early preview should still function but can no longer be managed or monitored remotely via the Microsoft Connected Cache Azure service.

We strongly recommend you [recreate your existing cache nodes in Azure](mcc-ent-create-resource-and-cache.md) and then [redeploy the caching software to your host machines](mcc-ent-deploy-to-windows.md) using the latest OS-specific installer.


## Next step
